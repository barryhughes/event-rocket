Unsupported set of experimental extensions, hacks and gadgetry for The Events Calendar

## Description

> As of October 2015, this plugin is largely unsupported and is unlikely to receive further bug fixes or
> improvements. Please consider that before using it in new projects.

Event Rocket is a set of hacks and utilities that add some extra capabilities to
[The Events Calendar](http://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) and
[Events Calendar PRO](http://tri.be/shop/wordpress-events-calendar-pro/). *It is no longer supported* and is
unlikely to receive further fixes.

## Installation

It's just like any other regular WordPress plugin - but it does expect [The Events Calendar](http://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/)
and, ideally, [Events Calendar PRO](http://tri.be/shop/wordpress-events-calendar-pro/) to be installed and activated.

### Manual installation

1. Download the latest version of the plugin and unzip it
2. Upload the resulting `event-rocket` plugin directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. You're done!

## Upgrade Notice

When the time comes to upgrade you need take no special precautions :-)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this plugin actively supported/maintained?

No.

### How can I find out more?

[The wiki](https://github.com/barryhughes/event-rocket/wiki) contains more detail on various topics
and is often worth looking at if you need more information. You can also find useful information
at [eventrocket.wordpress.com](https://eventrocket.wordpress.com/).

### How do I put the main events page on the front page of my site/blog?

* With Event Rocket activated, visit the Settings â†’ Reading admin screen
* Choose a static page for the front page
* Select _Main Events Page_ for the Front Page option
* Save!

### What are the shortcodes used to embed different widgets in pages/posts?

* `[event_rocket_list]` embeds the list widget _(should be considered deprecated if you are an Events Calendar *PRO* user)_

The remaining "widget wrappers" have now been deprecated and should not be used. If you are currently using them,
please transition to the official alternatives provided by Events Calendar PRO.

### Can I embed arbitrary events with a shortcode?

Yes - you can use the `[event_embed]` shortcode to do this (please [see here](https://github.com/barryhughes/event-rocket/wiki/Embed-Events)).
Examples:

* `[event_embed from="2014-07-01" to="2014-07-31"]` grab events in July
* `[event_embed from="2014-10-01" category="fruit"]` grab events starting in October that belong to the category _fruit_

### How can I specify the venue or event ID?

Both the countdown and venue widgets need to know which event or venue you are referring to. All of the following are
examples of acceptable ways to pass this information:

* `[event_rocket_venue id="123"]` which is nice and short
* `[event_rocket_venue venue_id="123"]` is also allowed
* `[event_rocket_countdown id="789"]` this time the ID relates to the event
* `[event_rocket_countdown event_id="789"]` again you can be more explicit if you wish

### How can I cleanup events data?

A new menu option will appear in the WordPress _tools_ menu labelled 'Cleanup events data' -  please note that
you are strongly cautioned to make a full and complete backup before using this tool (and, of course, should make
yourself aware of the steps needed to restore that backup).

### How do I enable RSVPs?

When Event Rocket is activated the event editor should contain a special new RSVP section. You must visit this
and enable RSVPs for each applicable event.

Once enabled an RSVP form will be displayed on single event pages: for best results you are encouraged to use the
_restrict to logged in users_ option, otherwise you run the potential of dealing with spam responses and other issues.

## Screenshots

1. Here you can see the new _Main Events Page_ entry in the Reading Settings screen.
2. Duplicating an event - simply click the duplicate link in the admin events list and this convenient modal window appears
3. Editing venue coordinates (only applicable to users without Events Calendar PRO)
4. Cleanup tools menu entry
5. The actual cleanup screen
6. RSVP admin user interface - allow RSVPs on a per-event basis, restrict to logged in users only and view confirmation totals
