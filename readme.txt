Experimental extensions, hacks and gadgetry for The Events Calendar

== Description ==

> *Need help?* Please do take the time to read through our [FAQs](https://wordpress.org/plugins/event-rocket/faq/),
> [wiki](https://github.com/barryhughes/event-rocket/wiki) and

This is an add-on that builds on top of the following wonderful plugins:

* [The Events Calendar](http://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) (required)
* [Events Calendar PRO](http://tri.be/shop/wordpress-events-calendar-pro/) (optional but recommended)
* Version 3.10 or greater for both of the above are suggested

So if you don't already have them installed it behooves you to do so now. This plugin then adds the following power-ups:

* Embed events *anywhere* using the `[event_embed]` shortcode
* Venues and organizers can also be embedded anywhere
* Place the main events page on the front page of your blog
* Precise editing of venue coordinates (sometimes street addresses just don't cut it!)
* Clean up and remove events data if you decide you don't need them any longer
* Duplicate events with a single click and optionally set the duplicated event's new date
* Simple but very flexible RSVP system - allow users to indicate if they will or will not attend an event

Check out the FAQs and screenshots for more examples. A wealth of information and context as to why things work the
way they do can also be found within the forum.

== Installation ==

It's just like any other regular WordPress plugin - but it does expect [The Events Calendar](http://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/)
and, ideally, [Events Calendar PRO](http://tri.be/shop/wordpress-events-calendar-pro/) to be installed and activated.

= Manual installation =

1. Download the latest version of the plugin and unzip it
2. Upload the resulting `event-rocket` plugin directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. You're done!

== Upgrade Notice ==

When the time comes to upgrade you need take no special precautions :-)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I find out more? =

[The wiki](https://github.com/barryhughes/event-rocket/wiki) contains more detail on various topics
and is often worth looking at if you need more information.

= How do I put the main events page on the front page of my site/blog? =

* With Event Rocket activated, visit the Settings â†’ Reading admin screen
* Choose a static page for the front page
* Select _Main Events Page_ for the Front Page option
* Save!

= What are the shortcodes used to embed different widgets in pages/posts? =

* `[event_rocket_list]` embeds the list widget _(should be considered deprecated if you are an ECP user)_
* `[event_rocket_calendar]` embeds the calendar widget _(deprecated)_
* `[event_rocket_countdown]` embeds the event countdown widget _(deprecated)_
* `[event_rocket_venue]` embeds the featured venue widget _(deprecated)_

Please note however that if you are not using Events Calendar PRO then any widgets specific to that plugin (such as the
countdown and calendar widget) will *not* be available.

= Can I embed arbitrary events with a shortcode? =

Yes - you can use the `[event_embed]` shortcode to do this (please [see here](https://github.com/barryhughes/event-rocket/wiki/Embed-Events)).
Examples:

* `[event_embed from="2014-07-01" to="2014-07-31"]` grab events in July
* `[event_embed from="2014-10-01" category="fruit"]` grab events starting in October that belong to the category _fruit_

= How can I specify the venue or event ID? =

Both the countdown and venue widgets need to know which event or venue you are referring to. All of the following are
examples of acceptable ways to pass this information:

* `[event_rocket_venue id="123"]` which is nice and short
* `[event_rocket_venue venue_id="123"]` is also allowed
* `[event_rocket_countdown id="789"]` this time the ID relates to the event
* `[event_rocket_countdown event_id="789"]` again you can be more explicit if you wish

= How can I cleanup events data? =

A new menu option will appear in the WordPress _tools_ menu labelled 'Cleanup events data' - by default this *only*
appears when The Events Calendar is deactivated. You are strongly cautioned to make a full and complete backup before
using this tool (and, of course, should make yourself aware of the steps needed to restore that backup).

= How do I enable RSVPs? =

When Event Rocket is activated the event editor should contain a special new RSVP section. You must visit this
and enable RSVPs for each applicable event.

Once enabled an RSVP form will be displayed on single event pages: for best results you are encouraged to use the
_restrict to logged in users_ option, otherwise you run the potential of dealing with spam responses and other issues.

== Screenshots ==

1. Here you can see the new _Main Events Page_ entry in the Reading Settings screen.
2. Duplicating an event - simply click the duplicate link in the admin events list and this convenient modal window appears
3. The actual output with the countdown widget embedded in the page. A great example as it also shows the sort of flaws
in terms of styling that can occur theme to theme (ie, to make things super-seamless some CSS knowledge is going to be
required).
4. Editing venue coordinates
5. Cleanup tools menu entry (will not normally appear unless The Events Calendar has been deactivated)
6. The actual cleanup screen
7. RSVP admin user interface - allow RSVPs on a per-event basis, restrict to logged in users only and view confirmation totals
